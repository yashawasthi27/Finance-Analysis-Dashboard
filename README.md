## 🧠 DAX Measures

```dax
-- Total Sales
Total Sales = SUM(Transactions[Amount])

-- Total Transactions
Total Transactions = COUNTROWS(Transactions)

-- Average Transaction Value
Avg Transaction Value = AVERAGEX(Transactions, Transactions[Amount])

-- Dynamic Metric Switcher (Core Feature)
Selected Metric =
SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE('Metrics'[Metric]),
    "Total Sales",            [Total Sales],
    "Total Fee",              SUM(Transactions[Fee]),
    "Total Tax",              SUM(Transactions[Tax]),
    "Avg Transaction Value",  [Avg Transaction Value],
    [Total Sales]
)

-- Transaction Success Rate
Success Rate % =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Transactions), Transactions[Status] = "Success"),
    COUNTROWS(Transactions)
)
```
